            <p class="blog-paragraph">After months of negotiation and debate, the U.S. House of Representatives could be
                poised to pass a two-part legislative package aimed at overhauling the country’s notoriously aging
                infrastructure. But House Democrats (who hold a majority in the chamber) have yet to reach an agreement
                on
                one part: a bill that focuses on social programs and fighting climate change.....</p>

            <p class="blog-paragraph">Jupiter, king of the gods in Roman mythology, shrouded himself in clouds to hide
                his true nature. But his wife, the goddess Juno, was able to peer past this veil and reveal his
                mischievous behavior.

                It is fitting, then, that the NASA spacecraft now circling Jupiter the planet is named after Juno. The
                gas giant obscures its inner workings with opulent swirls and bands of clouds, and the Juno orbiter is
                tasked with probing past this barrier to search for clues about the planet’s origin and evolution. What
                secrets lie beneath?.....</p>

            <p class="blog-paragraph">In the midst of a conversation with an acquaintance, your brain might skip ahead,
                anticipating the words that the other person will say. Perhaps then you will blurt out whatever comes to
                mind. Or maybe you will nurse your guess quietly, waiting to see if—out of all the hundreds of thousands
                of possibilities—your conversational partner will arrive at the same word you have been thinking of.
                Amazingly, your companion will often do so.

                How does the brain do this? Figuring out how we process language has long been a focus for
                neuroscientists. Mass.....</p>

                Series titles before he was diagnosed with a devastating disease in 1939, when he was still in his
                mid-30s. The disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), causes the motor neurons that enable muscle
                movement to deteriorate, gradually leading to the loss of the ability to move, eat, speak and even
                breathe. Gehrig’s illness, which had already been documented for decades, hel....</p>

            <p class="blog-paragraph">How much time do you spend doing research before you make a decision? The answer
                for many of us, it turns out, is “hardly any,” even with major investments. Most people make two trips
                or fewer to a dealership before buying a car. And according to survey results in a 2003 paper by
                economist Katherine Harris, when picking a doctor, many individuals use recommendations from friends and
                family rather than consulting other health care professionals or “formal sources”...</p>
